# Using AI for Fair Multiplayer Matchmaking with Amazon GameLift FlexMatch and Amazon Sagemaker AI - Part 2 Sample Code

## Background

In competitive multiplayer games, skill-based matchmaking is crucial for creating fun and competitive games. Determining player skill today is difficult due to the vast array of metrics games record - such as hits, misses, assists, time played, level, and more - making it challenging to manually determine which factors are most indicative of skill. Instead of manually creating algorithms to determine player skill, machine learning (ML) techniques—particularly supervised learning—can automatically identify patterns across game metrics to produce more accurate skill ratings. These ML-derived ratings lead to fairer matchmaking and ultimately improve the player experience.

This code is intended to be used with the [Amazon GameLift Testing Toolkit](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-gamelift-testing-toolkit).

This repository contains the completed code samples that are used in the Using AI for Fair Multiplayer Matchmaking with Amazon GameLift FlexMatch and Amazon Sagemaker Part 2 blog.
